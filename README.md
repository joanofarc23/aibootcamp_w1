# Applying Collaborative Robotics *(Cobots)* with Machine Learning to take on “Dull, Dirty and Dangerous” jobs within scope of military and commercial industries

* Name of company: **AvaWatz**

* When was the company incorporated? * AvaWatz was founded in 2019.  

* Who are the founders of the company? * 

Dr. Rajini Anachi is the founder and CEO of  AvaWatz.  This is Dr. Anachi’s third technology startup.  Her first two startups were financially successful from inception to end (buyout). 

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?*  

In collaboration with the U.S. Department of Defense, there was an identified need to develop robotic AI technologies to assist in “dull, dirty and dangerous” missions.  A patent was filed in May of 2023, titled "System and Method for Labeling, Evaluation, and Improvement of Training and Testing for Machine Learning,", which is the foundation of the platforms and  solutions offered.  AvaWatz developed three Software Platforms: “Arya”, “Genie” (patent pending) and “Falcon”(patent pending) , and three product solutions:  “Haya”, “Arwen”  and “Dari”. 1

The ARYA “enables teams of mobile robotic agents to work together with people, either autonomously or cooperatively, to perform complex multidisciplinary tasks that are either too dangerous or tedious for people to accomplish alone”.  The GENIE “creates high confidence AI models through “memory labels”, and FALCON manages error detection, classification and correction. 

Over the past 18 months, AvaWatz has been working with the Department of Defense (DOD) to improve the reliability of their robotic solutions.  AvaWatz AI uses Machine learning that synchronizes on the ground robots (rovers and vehicles) with in the air drones to provide solutions to provide safer, real-time solutions to dangerous missions for the DOD.   

 “Haya” AI synchronizes ground and air robotics to clear airfields from dangerous FOD (Foreign Object Debris).  This job is historically performed through humans riding in trucks and/or walking the airfield to pick up debris.  Clearing a runway this way is inefficient, laborious, costly, and has the potential for a high level of human error.  FODs that are not identified can severely damage high-cost aircraft and/or injure pilots/aircrew upon take-off or landing.    Machine learning is incorporated with on the ground rovers/vehicles and in the air drones to more efficiently and effectively identify FOD.   The system ensures the “human in the loop”- meaning human autonomy is at the end of every final decision the Haya suggests.  The website states there is minimal human training required, and safety/security are integrated into the platform. The “Haya” appears to be the main component of the AvaWatz business at the time of this writing.

“Arwen” provides uses the same robotics to enhance security in vulnerable public places. It uses 3-D imagery to rapidly process vast amounts of data, offering a proactive defense against security threats.  

“Dari” is an added layer of protection for the movement of ground troops, and increase vehicle survivability in dangerous and harsh conditions.  Pairing humans with robots, the goal is to recognize threats quickly to provide warnings and guidance in real time. 

Additionally, applications of AvaWatz’s patented technologies in the commercial sector are also being developed, as discussed in a webinar posted on wefunder.com.   There is obviously an opportunity for expansion to the public aviation industry.   Investors are also looking at applying technologies to the hospitality (hotel), short term rentals, and senior living (healthcare) industries. This provides a more robust portfolio and reaches additional market segments, while minimizing risks to investors.  https://wefunder.com/updates/170717-final-webinar-recording

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? AvaWatz has been funded through pre-seed monies of $4 million, and $2 million from the department of defense.  Through Wefunder, they are seeking an additional $5 million, currently at $1,348,839 at the time of this writing.

### Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve? * 

FOD also has the potential to damage aircraft tires, engines and fuselages, putting humans at risk for injury and death. FOD in military environments could lead to mission failure, reducing air defense and other mission capabilities, and put national security at risk.  Additionally, FOD costs the civilian aviation sector between $4 billion and $13 billion annually in damaged equipment, flight delays, reduced efficiency, litigation and other costs.  https://www.fodcontrol.com/what-is-fod/


* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? *  

Currently, the intended customer is the U.S. Department of Defense.  Two contracts for $16 million are expected to go to AvaWatz within the next 6 months.  Should those contracts execute successfully, the market will likely open to international NATO defense partners, and the international aviation industry. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? * 

EvaWatz’s value proposition, compared to competitors is their proprietary patented AI software platforms of the ARYA, GENIE and FALCON, which drives the synchronicity between robots for a more thorough, effective solutions to clearing FOD.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? *

AvaWatz's technologies include robotics tied to End-to-End private / hybrid Cloud-based SaaS and real-time AI solutions and robust Machine Learning.

#### Landscape

* What field is the company in?*  AvaWatz is currently in the Defense and Aviation industries, but with potential to reach other market shares in hospitality and senior living.   

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5-10 years?* According to CHAT GPT, The Department of Defense has put out Request for Proposals (RFPs) for FOD removal solutions since the early 1970’s.  Since 2010’s RFPs were made to include the use of technology for FOD removal.  

* What are the other major companies in this field? *  A press release on AvaWatz’s website indicates there is no current competitor who offers the full solutions of software and hardware “cobot” solutions.  A google search indicates that IBM, Seiman’s Government Technologies along with Turbine One are also developing FOD removal Technologies.

##### Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far? * AvaWatz has earned a $2million grant from the department of defense, and their technology is currently being implemented by the US Army and Air Force for FOD removal. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics? * The main core metrics to measure success will be if AvaWatz earns the two $16 million contracts from the Department of Defense in the next 6 months. Additionally, 2024 year end financials should show an revenue stream instead of a loss, along with additional opportunities and sales pipeline opportunities reported.    

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field? Unknown at this time.

###### Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? Upon interview of a seasoned United Airline’s Pilot, 1st Officer A.M. Mellas, another recommendation was discussed to further technologies for robotics already on the airfield. 1st. Officer Mellas suggested using the same robotics with AI to detect if de-icing measures continue to be satisfactory before takeoff.  It can be difficult to tell if de-icing completed on the tarmac is still effective following taxi and awaiting departure when visibility is poor.  This would increase safety and efficiency for aircraft departures in cold weather icing conditions.   

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?  Adding de-icing features would potentially decrease the number of times that additional de-icing would be required, as a flight crew must always err on the side of caution if they are uncertain if de-icing is still effective.  Having increased confidence in de-icing status prior to take off  would further allow the general aviation market to invest in the technology to increase safety and increase efficiency of operations.  This would potentially provide significant cost savings to airlines, airports and passengers over the long run.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? * This product would use the same technologies as the FOD AI Cobots.  

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? * The same technologies would be appropriate because the potential airfield would already have the software and hardware solutions on deck.  Adding the software programming to detect de-icing needs would add value to the initial investment.  AvaWatz could upsell a de-icing software package in addition to the FOD removal package.
